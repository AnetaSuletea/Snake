# Snake
A Snake Game made in C.

It is a simple snake game made in C++ that implements the functionality of a snake from the well-known Snake game.
It contains a matrix with the ASCII code of empty space or colored space. It has a border and a snake in the middle.
Random points appear at random positions. When the snake meets a colored space the game is over. Snake is made using a linked list 
that links all the 'snake pieces' one after another, creating the impression of movement. When the user presses 'W' snake moves up, 'S' - down, 'A' - left, 'D' - right.
The matrix is displayed over and over again to show the movement of the snake.
